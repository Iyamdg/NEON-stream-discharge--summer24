Description: Contains functions to format data and calculate stream discharge in liters per second
	(lps). For slug injections the area under the curve of a conductivity timeseries and injectate
	mass are used as imputs. For constant rate injections the plateau concentration and background
	tracer concentration are used as inputs.
