<!-- ****** Description ****** -->
This package allows you view and interact with select hydrologic data collected at 29 stream,  river, and lake inflow/outflow sites across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  NEON spans the continential United States and includes monitoring sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. In this package you can visually explore data from the following NEON Data Products:

* Stage-discharge rating curves [(DP4.00133.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00133.001)
* Continuous discharge [(DP4.00130.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00130.001)
* Precipitation [(DP1.00006.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00006.001)
* Land-water interface images [(DP1.20002.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.20002.001)

The `neonStageQPlot` package was developed to work in conjunction with the [openFlow](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/tree/master/shiny-openFlow) shiny application, but the functions can also be run independently outside the openFlow app.

<!-- ****** Usage ****** -->
## How to Install & Run the App

The **neonStageQPlot** package is only available for install from Github. To install the package:

`devtools::install_github(repo = "NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/shinyApp/neonStageQPlot", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)`

## App Dependencies

The shiny app downloads published data from the [NEON Data Portal](https://data.neonscience.org/home) using the [neonUtilities](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities) package. Users must have the neonUtilities (available in [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neonUtilities/index.html)) package installed to run the app.

The shiny app uses the [stageQCurve](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/tree/master/L4Discharge/stageQCurve) package. The stageQCurve package is not available in CRAN and must be installed directly from Github:

`devtools::install_github(repo = "NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/L4Discharge/stageQCurve", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)`

To install the stageQCurve package, you may also need to install the [geoNEON](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-geolocation/tree/master/geoNEON) package that must also be installed directly from GutHub:

`devtools::install_github(repo = "NEONScience/NEON-geolocation/geoNEON", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)`

## Functions

`get.cont.Q.NEON.API` - Downloads NEON continuous discharge and precipitation data from the NEON API, smooths the data to a 20 minute temporal resoltion, and outputs a data frame that contains the summarized data.

`cont.Q.plot` - Plots NEON continuous discharge and precipitation data using outputs from _get.cont.Q.NEON.API_.

`RC.plot` - Plots NEON stage-discharge rating curves data using outputs from _get.cont.Q.NEON.API_.

`pheno.GET` - Generates a URL with which a user can render a PhenoCam image from the PhenoCam API.
