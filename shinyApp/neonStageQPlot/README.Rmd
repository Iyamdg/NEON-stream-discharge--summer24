<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This interactive shiny app plots NEON stage-discharge rating curve and continuous discharge data using language R. In the left panel, users can input a domain ID, site ID and date range for which they want data plotted. Users can include quality flags in the continuous discharge plot before or after clicking submit. Graphs are render in the right panel after user click the submit button. The first tab from the left displays a continuous discharge plot for the selected time range, and the second tab plots the rating curves used in predicting continuous discharge.

Note: All data plotted on this app is sourced from the [NEON Data Portal](https://data.neonscience.org/home) using the [neonUtilities](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities) R package.

<!-- ****** Usage ****** -->
## User Inputs

**NEON Domain & Site Selection**

User makes a selection from 19 domains, then chooses a site id from the sites available in  the domain.

**Date Range**

Ability to specify date ranges for which data is to be visualized.

**Quality Flag Viewer**

Functionality for toggling  between Final Review quality flags, Science Review quality flags before or after clicking the submit button. When activated, the quality flags will be rendered as a shaded backround on the continuous discharge plot spanning the flagged time range.

"Include Final Quality Flag" = Discharge final quality flag indicating whether a data product has passed or failed an overall assessment of its quality; detailed in ATBD.

"Include Science Review Quality Flag" = Discharge final quality flag indicating whether a data product has failed a science review of its quality detailed in NEON.DOC.001113.

## App Outpus

**Site Description**

Contains a hyperlink of user selected site description hosted on [The NEON Website](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/explore-field-sites)

**Metadata Table**

The metaData table Contains some  key variables associated with the  selected Site ID.

* Upstream watershed area (km^2):	The area (km2) of land that drains water into the aquatic site. 

* Reach slope (m): 	The gradient (m) of the stream bed from the upstream to downstream reach boundary of the aquatic site.
Slope is measured using a total station during topographic site surveys. 

* Mean bankfull width (m):	The mean bankfull width (m) of the channel measured with total station instruments at transects located throughout the monitoring reach.  At bankfull stage water is just beginning to spill out of the channel and into the floodplain.  Bankfull flows typically occur at 1.5-year recurrence intervals.  

* D50 particle size(mm):	The diameter (mm) of bed substrate corresponding to 50% finer in the particle-size distribution.   Substrate is measured throughout the monitoring reach using 200-point pebble count methods.  

**Continuous Discharge Plot**

The continuous Discharge graph represents the  predicted continuous discharge from sensor-based surface water pressure and stage-discharge. 

The plot includes: 

* Continuous discharge (black line)

* Discharge uncertainty (red and pink ribbons)

* Empirical discharge (purple points)

* Continuous stage (blue line)

* Stage uncertainty (light blue ribbon)

* Empirical stage (orange points)

User can perform the following on this graph:

* Zoom in an out of graphs by right-click the section they what to view and dragging the mouse to a any stop

* Toggle legend attributes on the graph ON and OFF by clicking their on their representation in the legend

* Change discharge scales between linear and log by clicking either buttons

* Switch tabs to view the rating curve plot

**Stage-Discharge Rating Curve(s) Plot**

The rating curve graph plots the relationship between stage and discharge. 

The plot includes:

* Posterior rating curve (black line)

* Empirical stage-discharge pairs (black points)

* Rating curve uncertainty (red and pink ribbons)

User can perform the following on this graph:

* Zoom in an out of graphs by right-click the section they what to view and dragging the mouse to a any stop

* Toggle legend attributes on the graph ON and OFF by clicking their on their representation in the legend

* Change discharge scales between linear and log by clicking either buttons

* Switch tabs to view the continuous discharge plot
