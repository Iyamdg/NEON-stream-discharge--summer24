## User Inputs

**NEON Domain & Site Selection**

User makes a selection from 19 domains, then chooses a site id from the sites available in  the domain.

**Date Range**

Ability to specify date ranges for which data is to be visualized 

**Quality Flag Viewer**

Functionality for toggling  between Final Review quality flags, Science Review quality flags before or after clicking the submit button.

## App Outpus

**Site Description**

Contains a hyperlink of user selected site description hosted on neeonscience.org

**Metadata Table**

The metaData table Contains some  key variables and their  associated with the  selected Site ID.

Upstream watershed area (km^2):	The area (km2) of land that drains water into the aquatic site. 

Reach slope (m): 	The gradient (m) of the stream bed from the upstream to downstream reach boundary of the aquatic site.
Slope is measured using a total station during topographic site surveys. 

Mean bankfull width (m):	The mean bankfull width (m) of the channel measured with total station instruments at transects located throughout the monitoring reach.  At bankfull stage water is just beginning to spill out of the channel and into the floodplain.  Bankfull flows typically occur at 1.5-year recurrence intervals.  

D50 particle size(mm):	The diameter (mm) of bed substrate corresponding to 50% finer in the particle-size distribution.   Substrate is measured throughout the monitoring reach using 200-point pebble count methods.  

**Continuous Discharge Plot**
The continuos Discharge graph represents the  predicted continuous dischage from sensor-based surface water pressure and stage-discharge.

**Stage-Discharge Rating Curve(s) Plot**
The rating curve graph plots the relationship between  Stage and Discharge
