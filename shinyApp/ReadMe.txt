---------- WELCOME TO THE NEON STAGE-DISCHARGE RATING CURVE AND CONTINUOUS DISCHARGE SHINY APP ----------

Contents:
		
	*	Folder "neonStageQPlot" contains R package neonStageQPlot with associated documentation. The R
		package neonStageQPlot contains the "run.RC.cont.Q.plot.R" function that runs a shiny app to
		visualize NEON's stage-discharge rating curve and continuous discharge data products.

	*	Data frame "aqu_dischargeDomainSiteList.csv" contains a list of the NEON domains and site IDs 
		that have continuous discharge data published to the NEON Data Portal. The data frame also
		contains metadata for each site that is rendered in the application.
		
	*	.Rds file "rcPlottingData.rds" contains the data needed to plot the posterior rating curve with
		associated uncertainties.
